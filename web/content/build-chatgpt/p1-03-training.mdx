      ## The Loop
      
      We use a standard training loop with `CrossEntropyLoss` and `Adam`. Since the dataset is synthetic, it should converge very quickly (within minutes on a CPU).

      ## Seeing the Brain
      
      The best part of this project is seeing the "brain" of the model.
      
      ### Your Task
      1. Train the model until it achieves >99% accuracy.
      2. Extract the attention weights from the Cross-Attention layer.
      3. Plot a heatmap. You should see a clear diagonal line (or anti-diagonal for reversal), proving the model is "looking" at the correct input token!
