      ## The Process
      
      Now that the model is trained, we want to generate text.
      
      1.  Start with a prompt.
      2.  Feed it to the model to get logits.
      3.  **Sample** from the logits (Temperature, Top-K).
      4.  Append the new token to the sequence.
      5.  Repeat.
      
      ### Your Task
      Implement the `generate` function and build a simple CLI chat interface to talk to your model.
