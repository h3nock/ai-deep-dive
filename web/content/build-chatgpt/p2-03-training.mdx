      ## MLOps Essentials
      
      Writing a `for` loop is easy. Writing a training loop that doesn't crash after 2 days and lose all your progress is hard.
      
      1.  **Checkpointing**: Save your model weights (`model.state_dict()`) every $N$ steps.
      2.  **Logging**: Don't just `print()`. Use a logger or a tool like **Weights & Biases**.
      3.  **Validation**: Periodically evaluate on a held-out set.
      
      ### Your Task
      Implement a robust training loop that saves checkpoints and logs metrics.
