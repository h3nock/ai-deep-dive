      ## Text is just Bytes
      
      Before we build a brain, we must understand the input. To a computer, "Hello" is not a greeting; it's a sequence of numbers.
      
      ### Unicode & UTF-8
      Every character you see on this screen is mapped to a unique number (Code Point) by the Unicode standard.
      - 'A' -> U+0041
      - '😊' -> U+1F60A
      
      These code points are stored as **Bytes** (usually via UTF-8 encoding).
      
      ### The Challenge
      Neural Networks do not process raw bytes well (too many possibilities, too long sequences). We need a way to group these bytes into meaningful chunks. This leads us to **Tokenization**.
      
      ### Your Task
      We will start by inspecting raw text data in Python to see the underlying bytes.
