      ## The Lego Brick

      We have all the pieces: Multi-Head Attention, Feed-Forward, LayerNorm, and Residuals. Now we combine them into a single "Transformer Block".

      ### The Architecture
      A single block consists of:
      1. Multi-Head Attention (with residuals & norm)
      2. Feed-Forward Network (with residuals & norm)

      ### Challenge
      Implement the `TransformerBlock` class. It should take `d_model`, `n_head`, and `dropout` as arguments and instantiate the sub-layers.
