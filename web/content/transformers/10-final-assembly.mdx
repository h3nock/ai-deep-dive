      ## The Full Architecture

      We are ready to build the full model.

      ### The Architecture
      1. **Embeddings**: Token + Positional
      2. **Layers**: A stack of $N$ Transformer Blocks
      3. **Final Norm**: A final LayerNorm
      4. **Head**: A linear projection to vocabulary size (logits)

      ### Challenge
      Implement the `GPT` class. Connect everything together. Define the `forward` pass that takes indices and returns logits.
