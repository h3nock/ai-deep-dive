      ## Assembly Time

      We have all the blocks. Now we stack them to create the full Transformer architecture. We'll discuss the difference between Encoder-only (BERT), Decoder-only (GPT), and Encoder-Decoder (T5) models.

      ### What we'll build
      - The `TransformerBlock`.
      - The full `Transformer` class.
