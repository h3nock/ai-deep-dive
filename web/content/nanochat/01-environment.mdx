<Step title="Initialize Project">
<Description>

We'll start by creating a clean workspace. Instead of cloning a massive repository, we will build the project file-by-file to ensure you understand every component. We use `uv` for project management because it's significantly faster than standard pip. Run the commands to create a new directory (we'll call it `nanochat`, but you can name it whatever you like) and initialize it as a Python project.

<Action>
  <Command comment="Create directory">mkdir nanochat</Command>
  <Command comment="Enter directory">cd nanochat</Command>
  <Command comment="Initialize project">uv init</Command>
</Action>
</Step>

<Step title="Install Dependencies">
<Description>

We need a few core libraries to get started. **PyTorch** is the deep learning framework we'll use, while **Numpy** handles efficient numerical operations. We'll also need **Tiktoken** for tokenization and **Datasets** to download FineWeb-EDU.

</Step>

<Step title="Activate Environment">
<Description>

`uv` automatically creates a virtual environment for you in `.venv`. Activate it to ensure you're using the isolated Python version and dependencies. Once activated, your shell prompt should change to indicate the environment is active.

  <Command>source .venv/bin/activate</Command>
