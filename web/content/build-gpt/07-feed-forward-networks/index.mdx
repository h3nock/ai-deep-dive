description: "How the feed-forward network transforms each token independently."

<Description>
  The previous chapters gave each token a context-aware representation through attention, where tokens gather relevant information from other positions in the sequence. This chapter introduces the feed-forward network (FFN), which takes each token's enriched vector and rewrites its features through a learned transformation applied at every position. Attention controls what information flows between positions, and the FFN controls how that information gets processed within each position.
